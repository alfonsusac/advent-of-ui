# Holiday Accordion

The countdown timer has motivated the elves to organize their tasks better, but their lists are overwhelming and cluttered! Inspired by the countdown’s sparkling design, Santa decides to add a Holiday Accordion to categorize tasks neatly. This will group related items like toy-making, sleigh maintenance, and gift wrapping.

## Challenge:
Design an accordion with:

- Smooth animations that match the glowing effects of the magical buttons.
- Festive category headers (e.g., candy canes, bells, or gift icons).
- Clickable sections to expand/collapse, reusing the hover effects from Day 2 for a consistent feel.

## Example Output:

```markdown
+ 🎁 Wrapping Gifts  
   - Wrap 10 bicycles  
   - Pack dollhouses  

+ 🛷 Sleigh Maintenance  
   - Polish runners  
   - Check reindeer harnesses  
```

Clicking a category smoothly expands the section with a glow.
