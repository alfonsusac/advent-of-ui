# Santa's Wish List Component

## Story

This year, Santa decided to modernize his operations. The elves have been managing the Wish Lists on spreadsheets, but now Santa wants an interactive web component! He needs a clean, easy-to-use Wish List interface to display children's gift requests, organized neatly in a card format.

## Challenge:
Design a basic reusable "Wish Card" component using web technologies. Each card should display:

1. Child's Name
2. Gift Request
3. Status: "Nice" or "Naughty"
4. Interactive Toggle: A button that marks the child as "Reviewed" and changes the cardâ€™s style to indicate completion.

## Example Output

```yaml
+-------------------------+
| Name: Timmy             |
| Gift: Red Bicycle       |
| Status: Nice            |
| [Mark as Reviewed]      |
+-------------------------+
```
